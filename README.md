* what is a virtual machine?
  
Speak in briefly, it is just making another computer inside of your original computer by sharing its hardware resources. 

So what is computer, there is a hardware resources including : 
-CPU, 
-Ram, 
-storage, 
-GPU(Graphics processing unit : a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing, and gaming applications.), 
-NIC (Network Interface Controller : which support computer to connect and communicate to network.)
********************
To use that resourses; like we use computer normally, we need a software in which is operating systems. For examples, the most used Windows, Mac, Linux etc. Normally for the computer device we use can only store one O.S. 

To use other O.S, then you need a new hardware resources, another computer. Whereas using "Hypervisor" can allow you to create how many of small computers inside of your device you want, unless it is at its capacity. Hypervisor is an application you installs on your operating system, such as Google Chrome, call of duty(Gaming APP), or this Virtual box.

Virtual box is an application that can help you to make a fake(virtual) computer sharing your original computer's hardware resources. But they are independent of physical hardware.
***************
There is two types of Hypervisor;

-Type 2 is something that like Vitual machine(Guest O.S)in which can be built on top of your own O.S (Host O.S). 
-Type 1 is like "vmware or exsi" which can be installed staight on top of hardware. so, you should erase your previous O.S to install this. Normally and typically type 1 is used for enterprises or companies and installed in big servers such as dell servers, hp servers. 
***************
Purpose of using the VM.......are;

Firstly, if you want to learn Hacking, to perform your hacking duties safe and most secure way, this is recommended by infamous platfrom 'hack me' 'hack the box'... 

Secondly, when you want to learn different O.S, this will be very helpful to use to wide up your skills. From companies perspectives, this is cutting the cost less and for those who starts their business will no more to strain of the cost burden as there is no many servers needed. 

Thirdly, you can break staff. For examples, you can try many things without worring and concerns of breakdown of hardwares as you built your new(fake=virtual) independent computer on host O.S. It doesn't effect your Host O.S at all. Whenever it broke,, then you can just delete it and rebuilt again. So the VM is the greatest environment to practice and experience.

Debian is a Linux-based operating system.

Protocols :
It is a set of rules that need to be followed by the communicating parties in order to have successful and reliable data communication, regarless of any differences in their internal processes, structures or design = how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. There is three main types of network; network management protocols, network communication protocols and network security protocol. For examples, there is HTTP and TCP/ip.
*what is API?
-API(Application Programming Interface) which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
